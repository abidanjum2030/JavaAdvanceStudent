### Java soft installation

```
32 bit/64 bit:
1. Install JDK 1.8
2. Install 7zip software
3. spring-tool-suite:
	>create C:\java-ws folder
	> copy zip file "spring-tool-suite-3.8.1" into C:\java-ws folder
	> extract it there using 7zip
	
	To run spring-tool-suite:
	> go to sts-bundle>sts-3.8.1.RELEASE>STS.exe
	> it will promt select workspace dialog?
	  #give path of your workspace: C:\java-ws
	  #tick checkbox (default)
	  #OK	
 ```
 
 ### Install Maven in Mac/Linux: 
`/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

Alternatively, I recommend installing Homebrew for these kinds of utilities.

Then you just install Maven using:
`brew install maven` <br/>
PS: If you got a 404 error, try doing a brew update just before

*Install Maven in Linux Ubuntu:*
`sudo apt-get install maven`
 
 ### How to install lombok in mac:
 
 ```
 Rename the file "STS.EXE" to "sts.exe" under ../sts-bundle/sts.app/Contents/MacOS/. 
And then run java -jar lomobok.jar and select the STS.ini file under ../sts-bundle/sts.app/Contents/Eclipse
```
